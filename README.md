# CYW920820EVB-02

### Overview

The Infineon CYW920820EVB-02 Evaluation Kit enables you to evaluate and develop single-chip Bluetooth&#174; applications using the CYW20820, an ultra-low-power dual-mode Bluetooth&#174; 5.2 wireless MCU device. The CYW20820 is a stand-alone baseband processor with an integrated 2.4 GHz transceiver supporting Bluetooth&#174; LE/BR/EDR. The CYW20820 delivers up to 10.5 dBm Tx power in LE and BR modes and up to 4 dBm in EDR mode that extends range in applications like home and industrial automation, wearables, toys, and HID. The CYW20820 employs high integration to reduce external components, thereby minimizing the device's footprint and cost. This kit helps evaluate device functionality and develop applications quickly for faster time-to-market. CYW20820 supports Bluetooth&#174; SIG-certified Mesh v1.0. CYW20820EVB-02 can also be used to develop LE Mesh applications on CYW20820 device using ModusToolbox&#8482;.

### Additional Information

Infineon also offers a purpose-built Bluetooth&#174; mesh kit that comes with four boards and several on-board sensors to implement more complete mesh application without any external hardware. To learn more about Infineon Bluetooth&#174; mesh evaluation kit, visit [CYBT-213043-MESH](http://www.cypress.com/CYBT-213043-MESH).

The CYW20820 device and the CYW920820EVB-02 evaluation kit are supported in ModusToolbox&#8482; 1.1 (or later). To learn more about ModusToolbox&#8482; and download the latest version, please visit the ModusToolbox&#8482; webpage.

Max UART baud rate is 3M.

External 32 kHz LPO is used by default. To operate without external LPO, set USE\_32K\_EXTERNAL\_LPO=0 on the make command line or edit the default value in CYW920820EVB-02.mk.
